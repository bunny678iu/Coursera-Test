<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 100px; text-align: center;">I love you!</h1>
<h2 style="color: blue; font-size: 60px; text-align: center;">You are the best thing that has happend to me. :)</h2>
<p style="color: purple; font-size: 30px; text-align: right;">I know this whole thing is still new for the both of us but I believe that we are getting the hang of it.  We are figuring this out together and it is at a place I would gladly let it stay for a while, if you know what I mean. ;)</p>
<p style="color: orange; font-size: 20px;">Also complete random side note this whole coding thing is really fun and honestly enjoyed learning this little bit so far, after messing up once.  I honestly can't believe I know how to change colors, font sizes and alignment already.</p>
